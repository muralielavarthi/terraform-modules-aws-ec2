terraform modules
=================
it is like a function, we pass inputs and will get the infra
Example: we pass required inputs to ec2-module and it will created ec2 infra
module "module-name" {
    # passing inputs to the module
}

1. In few terraform projects, there be separate team for module development.
2. In some projects, devops engineer will develop modules and use them.
3. provider file will present in expense project but not in module code.

Advantages of modules:
=======================
1. Code reuse
2. Enforce standards and best practices
3. maintainability - centralised place to updates (any changes we do in the module, will refelect across all projects using it)

- module developers, will create documentation on module and will share with team
- It is important to understand how execution happens in terraform files.

- .tfvars files, usally we will not push to github because it might contains senstive information and values will be 
   related to creator details, person cloning repo they should update their variables values in .tfvars files.

- we can keep modules in github and use it in expense project, will see this further.

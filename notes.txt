terraform modules
=================
it is like a function, we pass inputs and will get the infra
Example: we pass required inputs to ec2-module and it will created ec2 infra
module "module-name" {
    # passing inputs to the module
}

1. In few terraform projects, there be separate team for module development.
2. In some projects, devops engineer will develop modules and use them.
3. provider file will present in expense project but not in module code.

Advantages:
1. Code reuse
2.

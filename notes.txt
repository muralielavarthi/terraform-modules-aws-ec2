terraform modules
=================
it is like a function, we pass inputs and will get the infra
Example: we pass required inputs to ec2-module and it will created ec2 infra
advantage is code reuse, we can reuse the module in different projects.

module "module-name" {
    # passing inputs to the module
}

# In few terraform projects, there be separate team for module development.
# In some projects, devops engineer will develop modules and use them.

# provider file will present in expense project but not in module code.
